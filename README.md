# Co-localization of HP1 isoforms and H3K9me3 in neural stem cells using NGS 

A streamlined pipeline created for the analysis of Cut&Run data

## Getting Strated

### Program Description

H3K9me3 and HP1 isoform signals are processed using Snakemake to inspect their abundancy, co-localization, and potential redundancy. The files containing the results of the analysis are then processed in R to extract further information.

### Installing

The Snakefile along with all scripts and configuration files are ready for download 

## Built With

# Snakemake
* Snakemake (v. )
* R (v. )
